# Bitcoin Solo Mining Pool Speed Test

A cross-platform Python tool to help Bitcoin solo miners find the fastest public stratum mining pool server from their location.

## Why Use This Tool?

When solo mining Bitcoin, even small differences in connection speed can affect your mining efficiency (particularly noticeable with rejected share count). This script tests connectivity to major solo mining pools worldwide, measuring both network latency and full stratum protocol response times to help you choose the optimal pool server.

## How It Works

The script performs two tests for each pool:

1. **PING TEST** - Measures basic network latency using ICMP
2. **STRATUM HANDSHAKE** - Measures complete connection time including the mining.subscribe protocol handshake (this is what your miner actually experiences)

All servers are tested concurrently for fast results (~5-10 seconds total).

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher (Python 3.11+ recommended for best performance)
- No external dependencies (uses only standard library)
- Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

**Note**: Use `python3` if `python` is not available on your system.

## Installation

Clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mweinberg/stratum-speed-test.git
cd stratum-speed-test
```

Make it executable (Linux/macOS):

```bash
chmod +x stratum_test.py
```

## Usage

### Quick Test (Default)

Test all preconfigured pools with 1 run each:

```bash
python3 stratum_test.py  # or just 'python' on some systems
```

### TLS Connection Testing (New in v1.3, Enhanced in v1.4)

Test secure TLS stratum connections for pools that support it:

```bash
python stratum_test.py -t
```

This tests both regular and TLS connections, showing response times for each. TLS results appear in an additional column:
- **Number** = TLS connection time in milliseconds
- **-** = Pool doesn't support TLS
- **FAILED** = TLS connection failed (see detailed error message below table)

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.6+ (Python 3.7+ recommended for TLS 1.3 support)

**TLS-enabled pools:**
- AtlasPool.io (port 4333)
- Public Pool (port 4333)
- SoloMining.de (port 4333)
- Noderunners (port 1336)

**New in v1.4:** Skip certificate verification for testing IP addresses:

```bash
python stratum_test.py -t --no-verify-cert
```

**Warning:** Only use `--no-verify-cert` for testing purposes - it disables important security checks!

### Address Type Verification (New in v1.1)

Test which Bitcoin address types each pool supports:

```bash
python stratum_test.py -v
```

This tests all 5 address types (P2PKH, P2SH, P2WPKH, P2WSH, P2TR) and shows which formats each pool accepts. Results appear as additional columns in the output table:
- ✓ = Supported
- X = Not Supported  
- ? = Unknown (may require valid credentials)

**Note**: Verification adds ~10 seconds per server and uses reduced concurrency for reliability.

### Multiple Runs for Accuracy

Run multiple tests per server and get average with min-max range:

```bash
python stratum_test.py --runs 3
```

Valid options: `--runs 1`, `--runs 2`, or `--runs 3`

You can combine with verification:

```bash
python stratum_test.py --runs 3 -v
```

### Test a Specific Pool

Test a single pool server by providing the hostname and port as arguments:

```bash
python stratum_test.py <hostname> <port>
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# Test AtlasPool (note: use solo.atlaspool.io, not atlaspool.io)
python stratum_test.py solo.atlaspool.io 3333

# Test CKPool
python stratum_test.py solo.ckpool.org 3333

# Test with multiple runs for better accuracy
python stratum_test.py solo.atlaspool.io 3333 --runs 3

# Test with TLS (for predefined servers, TLS port is auto-detected)
python stratum_test.py public-pool.io 3333 -t

# Test with TLS on custom port
python stratum_test.py solo.atlaspool.io 3333 -t 4333
```

**Important:** Both hostname and port must be provided. The script will show an error if only one is specified.

### Pool Verification Tool (New in v1.1)

Use `verify_pool.py` to verify a solo mining pool will pay block rewards to YOUR address:

```bash
# Verify a specific address
python3 verify_pool.py solo.atlaspool.io 3333 bc1qxy2kgdygjrsqtzq2n0yrf2493p83kkfjhx0wlh

# Test all 5 address types
python3 verify_pool.py solo.atlaspool.io 3333 -a
```

**What it does:**
1. Connects to the pool as a mining worker
2. Requests a block template (mining work)
3. Parses the coinbase transaction
4. Verifies YOUR address appears in the payout outputs

**Results:**
- ✅ Address found - Pool will pay YOU if you find a block
- ⚠️ Unknown - Could not verify (may require valid credentials)
- ❌ Address NOT found - WARNING: Pool may not be legitimate!

This tool helps ensure you're using a legitimate solo mining pool that will actually pay you if you find a block, rather than paying the pool operator.

Summary:
------------------------------------------------------------
Fastest Ping:    AtlasPool.io (12 ms)
Fastest Stratum: AtlasPool.io (32 ms)

RECOMMENDATION: Consider using AtlasPool.io (solo.atlaspool.io:3333)
                for optimal mining performance from your location.
```

## Understanding the Results

**Stratum (ms)** is the most important metric - this is what your mining hardware actually experiences. Lower is better.

**Status codes:** Number = response time in ms, BLOCKED = ICMP blocked (pool still usable), N/A = connection failed

The script recommends pools within 3ms of the fastest stratum time.

## Tips for Best Results

- Test from the same network your miners use
- Use `--runs 3` for more accurate results
- VPN/proxy will affect location detection and results

## Adding Custom Pools

Test unlisted pools: `python stratum_test.py your.pool.com 3333`

To permanently add, edit `PREDEFINED_SERVERS` in the script: `(hostname, port, tls_port, display_name, country_code)`

## Troubleshooting

### "N/A" for both ping and stratum
- Server might be down
- Port might be blocked by firewall
- DNS resolution might have failed
- Check if you can reach the server: `ping hostname`

### "BLOCKED" for ping
- Normal - some pools block ICMP ping for security
- As long as stratum works, the pool is usable

### Script hangs or is slow
- Some servers might be timing out (5 second timeout per server)
- Try testing a specific server to isolate the issue
- Check your internet connection

### All pings show "BLOCKED"
- Verify ping command is available: `which ping`
- Check if ping requires elevated privileges on your system
- The script should work on all platforms with v1.5 improvements

### Permission errors on Linux/macOS
- Make the script executable: `chmod +x stratum_test.py`
- Or run with: `python3 stratum_test.py`

## Technical Details

### Concurrency
- Tests all servers simultaneously using 16 concurrent threads
- Total test time: ~5-10 seconds (limited by slowest server)
- Thread-safe and works on all platforms

### Timeouts
- Ping timeout: 2 seconds
- Stratum connection timeout: 5 seconds
- Multiple runs have 0.1 second delay between attempts

### Network Requirements
- Outbound TCP connections to pool ports (typically 3333, 7112, etc.)
- Outbound ICMP for ping tests (optional - script works without it)
- HTTPS access to ipify.org and ip-api.com for IP/location lookup
